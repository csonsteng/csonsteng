Hi! I am Chloe! I am a multi-faceted software developer with a specialization in Unity/C#. 
Outside of Unity my development experience consists primarily of TypeScript/React, python, ruby, and VBA.
However my experience does not stop there as I have lived a former life as an aerospace engineer.
While I have no plans to return to aerospace I belief it gives me a unique perspective to many challenges.

While I do enjoy making games, I find intrinsic reward solving software problems in any sector and enjoy pushing myself to try new things.

This is my personal github and only contains personal projects, many of which were started as a challenge or for an investigatory manner and are not typically developed in the same fashion as if they were production.
Please keep this in mind while perusing. 
Unfortunately I am unable to share any of my professionally developed code due to NDAs.

If you have any questions feel free to email me at chloe@csonsteng.com :) thank you! <3
