Hi! I am Chloe! I am currently a senior developer and product lead for an edutainment game built in Unit/C#. 
Outside of Unity my prior development experience consists primarily of python, JavaScript/React and VBA.
However my experience does not stop there as I have lived a former life as an aerospace engineer.
While I have no plans to return to aerospace I belief it gives me a unique perspective to many challenges.

While I do enjoy games, I find intrinsic reward solving software problems in any sector and enjoy pushing myself to try new things.
Since I being a lead I have faced many new challenges such as balancing the work-load of others as to not overwhelm them while maintaining pace.

This is my personal github and only contains personal projects, many of which were started as a challenge or for an investigatory manner and are not typically developed in the same fashion as if they were production.
Please keep this in mind while perusing. 
Unfortunately I am unable to share any of my professionally developed code due to NDAs.

If you have any questions feel free to email me at chloe@csonsteng.com :) thank you! <3
